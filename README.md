 Detection of Chagas Disease from the ECG: The George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2025

## Summary
The George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenges are annual competitions that invite participants to develop automated approaches for addressing important physiological and clinical problems. Chagas disease is a parasitic disease in Central and South America. It affects an estimated 6.5 million people and causes nearly 10,000 deaths annually. Serological testing can detect Chagas disease and allow for treatment that prevents or slows damage to the cardiovascular system, but testing capacity is limited. Chagas disease symptoms may also appear in electrocardiograms (ECG), so ECGs can help to prioritize individuals for the limited numbers of serological tests and inform the impacts of and treatments for Chagas disease. The George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2025 invites teams to develop open-source algorithmic approaches for identifying potential cases of Chagas disease from standard 12-lead ECGs.
